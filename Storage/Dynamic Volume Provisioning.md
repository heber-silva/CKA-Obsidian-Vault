[Dynamic volume provisioning](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/dynamic-provisioning/) allows storage volumes to be created on-demand. Without dynamic provisioning, cluster administrators have to manually make calls to their cloud or storage provider to create new storage volumes, and then create [[PersistentVolume]] objects to represent them in Kubernetes. The dynamic provisioning feature eliminates the need for cluster administrators to pre-provision storage. Instead, it automatically provisions storage when users create [`PersistentVolumeClaim` objects](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/).

## Background[](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/dynamic-provisioning/#background)

The implementation of dynamic volume provisioning is based on the API object `StorageClass` from the API group `storage.k8s.io`. A cluster administrator can define as many `StorageClass` objects as needed, each specifying a _volume plugin_ (aka _provisioner_) that provisions a volume and the set of parameters to pass to that provisioner when provisioning. A cluster administrator can define and expose multiple flavors of storage (from the same or different storage systems) within a cluster, each with a custom set of parameters. This design also ensures that end users don't have to worry about the complexity and nuances of how storage is provisioned, but still have the ability to select from multiple storage options.
